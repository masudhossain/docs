## File Organization

Develop a systematic approach to organizing project files in Queue that makes assets easy to find, share, and manage throughout the project lifecycle.

## File Structure Best Practices

- **Consistent Naming** - Use standardized file naming conventions across projects
- **Folder Hierarchy** - Create logical folder structures for different file types
- **Version Control** - Maintain clear versioning for design iterations and drafts
- **File Categories** - Organize by type (assets, deliverables, references, archives)
- **Access Permissions** - Control who can view, edit, or download specific files
- **Metadata Tags** - Use tags and descriptions for easy searching

## Recommended Folder Structure

1. **01-Project Brief** - Requirements, contracts, and initial planning documents
2. **02-Research** - Competitive analysis, inspiration, and reference materials
3. **03-Assets** - Raw assets, stock photos, fonts, and design elements
4. **04-Work in Progress** - Draft designs, concepts, and development files
5. **05-Client Deliverables** - Final files ready for client review or delivery
6. **06-Archive** - Old versions, rejected concepts, and completed iterations

## File Naming Conventions

- **Project_Phase_Item_Version** (e.g., "BrandCorp_Logo_Concept_v3.ai")
- **Date-based** (e.g., "2024-01-15_Homepage_Mockup.psd")
- **Status Indicators** (e.g., "FINAL_BrandGuide.pdf", "DRAFT_SocialPost.jpg")
- **Team Initials** (e.g., "Logo_Concepts_MH_v2.ai")

## File Management Tips

1. **Regular Cleanup** - Archive old versions and remove unnecessary files monthly
2. **Backup Strategy** - Ensure important files are backed up outside of Queue
3. **Team Training** - Establish and communicate file organization standards
4. **Client Access** - Create separate client-facing folders for easy sharing
5. **Search Optimization** - Use descriptive names and tags for findability

<Warning>
  Avoid storing very large files (>100MB) directly in Queue. Use cloud storage links for large video or high-resolution asset files.
