## Sharing Methods

- **Direct Project Access** - Give clients access to specific project folders
- **Shared Links** - Generate secure, time-limited links for individual files
- **Download Packages** - Create compressed archives of multiple files
- **Preview Mode** - Allow viewing without download permissions
- **Email Integration** - Send files directly through Queue's email system
- **Client Portal** - Organize files in branded client-facing portals

## Permission Levels

1. **View Only** - Can see and preview files but cannot download
2. **Download** - Can view and download files for offline use
3. **Comment** - Can add feedback and annotations to files
4. **Upload** - Can add new files to shared folders
5. **Full Access** - Can view, download, upload, and manage files

## Sharing Best Practices

- **Organize Before Sharing** - Clean up folders and remove work-in-progress files
- **Set Clear Permissions** - Only give necessary access levels to each user
- **Use Expiration Dates** - Set automatic expiration for sensitive shared links
- **Track Downloads** - Monitor who accesses files and when
- **Provide Context** - Include descriptions and instructions with shared files
- **Version Control** - Ensure clients always have access to the latest versions

## Client Sharing Workflow

1. **Prepare Files** - Organize and finalize files for client review
2. **Set Permissions** - Configure appropriate access levels for the client
3. **Create Share** - Generate secure sharing method (portal, link, or email)
4. **Notify Client** - Send professional notification with access instructions
5. **Track Activity** - Monitor client engagement with shared files
6. **Gather Feedback** - Collect client comments and approval status

<Tip>
  Use client portals for ongoing projects and direct links for one-time file sharing. This keeps long-term projects organized while providing flexibility for ad-hoc sharing needs.
