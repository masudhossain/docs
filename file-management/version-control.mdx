## Version Control

Maintain clear version history of your project files to track changes, prevent confusion, and ensure everyone is working with the most current assets.

## Version Control Features

- **Automatic Versioning** - Queue tracks file versions when new uploads replace existing files
- **Version History** - View complete history of file changes with timestamps
- **Compare Versions** - Side-by-side comparison of different file versions
- **Restore Previous** - Roll back to earlier versions when needed
- **Change Tracking** - See who made changes and when they occurred
- **Version Comments** - Add notes explaining what changed in each version

## Versioning Strategies

1. **Semantic Versioning**
   - v1.0 = Initial version
   - v1.1 = Minor changes/revisions
   - v2.0 = Major changes/complete revision

2. **Date-Based Versioning**
   - 2024-01-15_Logo_Concept
   - 2024-01-18_Logo_Revision
   - 2024-01-22_Logo_Final

3. **Status-Based Versioning**
   - Draft, Review, Approved, Final
   - Concept, Revision, Client-Ready

## Version Management Best Practices

- **Clear Naming** - Use descriptive names that indicate the version purpose
- **Regular Updates** - Upload new versions promptly when changes are made
- **Archive Old Versions** - Keep previous versions accessible but organized
- **Team Communication** - Notify team members when new versions are available
- **Client Versions** - Maintain separate client-ready versions vs. working files
- **Backup Strategy** - Ensure version history is included in backup procedures

## Common Version Control Scenarios

1. **Design Iterations** - Track logo concepts, website layouts, and creative revisions
2. **Document Updates** - Maintain version history for contracts, briefs, and specifications
3. **Code Releases** - Version control for website updates and application releases
4. **Client Feedback** - Track changes made in response to client feedback rounds

<Info>
  Queue automatically creates new versions when you upload a file with the same name. You can also manually create versions by uploading with different names.
