<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>

Step 1. Install Queue on your OS:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g queue
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add queue
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
queue dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Queue uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Queue runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
queue dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Queue in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Queue Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Queue. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g queue@latest
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global upgrade queue
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Startup
  Plan](https://queue.com/pricing)
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Troubleshooting
