- **Comments & Mentions** - When someone comments or mentions you
- **Deadline Alerts** - Reminders for upcoming or overdue deadlines
- **Project Milestones** - When important project phases are completed
- **Client Activity** - When clients view, comment, or approve deliverables

## Activity Feed Features

## Staying Organized

1. **Customize by Role** - Managers might want more notifications than individual contributors
2. **Project-Specific Settings** - High-priority projects can have more aggressive notifications
3. **Time-Based Rules** - Reduce notifications during off-hours or weekends
4. **Priority Filtering** - Only get alerts for high-priority or urgent items
5. **Regular Review** - Check activity feeds daily to stay current on all projects

<Info>
  Find the right balance - too many notifications can be overwhelming, while too few can cause you to miss important updates.
