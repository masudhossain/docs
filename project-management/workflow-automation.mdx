## Automation Opportunities

- **Task Assignment** - Automatically assign tasks based on project type or skills
- **Status Updates** - Move tasks to next column when conditions are met
- **Notifications** - Send alerts when deadlines approach or milestones are reached
- **Client Updates** - Automatically notify clients of project progress
- **Time Tracking** - Start/stop timers based on task status changes
- **Recurring Tasks** - Create repeating tasks for ongoing work

## Common Automation Rules

1. **New Project Setup**
   - Automatically create standard tasks from project template
   - Assign project manager and key team members
   - Set initial due dates based on project timeline

2. **Progress Notifications**
   - Notify client when project moves to "Review" status
   - Alert team lead when task is marked "Blocked"
   - Send reminder emails 24 hours before deadlines

3. **Quality Control**
   - Require manager approval before tasks move to "Complete"
   - Automatically create review tasks for design work
   - Flag projects that exceed budget thresholds

## Setting Up Automation

1. **Map Your Workflow** - Document current processes and identify repetitive steps
2. **Start Simple** - Begin with basic notifications and status changes
3. **Test Thoroughly** - Verify automations work correctly before full deployment
4. **Monitor Performance** - Track how automations affect team productivity
5. **Iterate and Improve** - Refine rules based on team feedback and results

<Info>
  Automation should enhance your workflow, not complicate it. Start with simple rules and gradually add complexity.
