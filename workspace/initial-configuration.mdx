## Configuration Areas

- **Project Templates** - Create reusable project structures for different service types
- **Custom Fields** - Add agency-specific data fields for projects and tasks
- **Workflow Columns** - Set up status columns that match your process stages
- **Automation Rules** - Configure automatic actions for common scenarios
- **Notification Settings** - Fine-tune alerts for different team roles

## Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Analyze Current Workflow** - Document your existing processes before configuring
2. **Create Project Templates** - Build templates for your most common project types
3. **Setup Custom Fields** - Add fields for client requirements, budgets, deadlines
4. **Configure Columns** - Create workflow stages (e.g., "Brief", "In Progress", "Review", "Complete")
5. **Test with Sample Project** - Run through a test project to validate configuration

<Info>
  Start with basic configuration and iterate. You can always add more complexity as your team becomes comfortable with Queue.
