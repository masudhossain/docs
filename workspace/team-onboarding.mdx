## Team Setup Process

- **Add Team Members** - Invite users via email with appropriate access levels
- **Role Assignment** - Set up Admin, Manager, and Team Member permissions
- **Project Access** - Control which projects team members can view and edit
- **Training Materials** - Provide essential Queue guides and best practices
- **Workflow Introduction** - Walk through your agency's specific processes

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small** - Begin with core team members before expanding
2. **Define Roles Clearly** - Establish what each role can and cannot do
3. **Provide Training** - Share relevant video guides for each team member's role
4. **Set Expectations** - Communicate your agency's Queue usage standards
5. **Regular Check-ins** - Schedule follow-up sessions to address questions

<Warning>
  Be careful with Admin permissions - only give these to trusted team members who need full system access.
