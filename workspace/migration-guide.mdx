## Migration Process

- **Data Assessment** - Inventory what needs to be moved from existing tools
- **Queue Setup** - Configure Queue to match or improve your current workflow
- **Data Transfer** - Import projects, tasks, and client information
- **Team Training** - Get everyone comfortable with the new system
- **Gradual Transition** - Phase migration to minimize disruption

## Common Migration Sources

1. **From Trello/Asana** - Project and task data, team assignments
2. **From Monday.com** - Complex workflows, custom fields, automation
3. **From Slack/Teams** - Communication history, file attachments
4. **From Spreadsheets** - Client lists, project tracking, time logs
5. **From Email** - Client communications, project correspondence

## Migration Timeline

**Week 1**: Setup and configuration
**Week 2**: Data import and testing
**Week 3**: Team training and parallel running
**Week 4**: Full transition and optimization

<Tip>
  Run Queue alongside your existing tools for 1-2 weeks to ensure everything works correctly before fully switching over.
